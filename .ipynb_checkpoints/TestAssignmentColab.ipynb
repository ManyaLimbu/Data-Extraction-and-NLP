Though in this 21st-century building Space shuttle and exploring space has become an obvious activity among the human raise, now with the inclusion of Start-ups like Space X once dreamed for reaching out at space now is coming true. We all have to agree upon a fact that in the Growth of industrialization we have generated a humungous carbon footprint and colonize at outer space will create a much-needed area for our survival.With time the human race has visualized and has undergone many transformations, and these transformations may for starters were not that effective but were a major role at existence to this age. Be it a natural transformation like shifting of tectonic plates or manmade like Dumping water and damaging water bodies, somehow have affected usual life of humans so creating space of humans is what next humans are eyeing for.All this idea for Colonizing in outer space emerged when NASA was able to launch a space shuttle with a heavy payload in the late 1990s this idea didn\\u2019t stir brain at that time but later was like apple eyes when various articles from astronauts and their writeup came into limelight and this idea saw its progression, space exploration was not a new normal, companies were petrified by the number of investments that these kinds of projects ask for. But things change with the entry of PayPal\\u2019s owner Elon Musk, in 2002 where he laid stones of Space X, with NASA providing the launchpad for their exploration.Being space travel legitimate there where many bottlenecks knowing the nature of outer space will boost the idea of colonizing, here one has to realize the optimum. But the main target that these company put forward with themself was to not just get into other planet but to get back at earth safely, earlier these projects due to high fund was always subdued and priority was given to the rocket technology. Thus, this unimaginable quest for the search of space was far-fetched though.Now being in 2020 we do not find it out of a place of colonizing outside of space, the kind of emergence of technologies has led to the escalation of spreading the roots of human existence, the plan for reaching out to outer space too plays a key role for this idea too. Proper Planning, Analysing, Organising, and Executing were required for these projects to be successful for deeper know how I would like to mention here an example of Space X, According to them they wud be successful for sending Rockets by 2022 and would able to colonize by 2050, For achieving these vision they have planned a total of 36 times pre-launch of the same rocket which they will be launching by 2020. Not only that they have already placed their star link satellites which will provide the basic network connectivity for their colonized world, they have planned this to that extent that they have targeted a profit of $ 22 billion yearly by 2025. Already they have sent the first manned rocket successfully what Elon musk plan is to create that infrastructure by which going to Mars with cost as a regular air flight ticket all this will lead to better chances for colonizing at another planet. With setting up their commercial flight once started to the red planet it wud just be a stepping stone for the colonizing at the outer space.But the fundamental change that people have to undergo while living on another planet will be a change in gravity and being able to be near to live support if any technical issues arise to their suit until unless we find a similar place like the earth that is the change which humans have to adjust. Aspects like Ultraviolet rays too will play an immense role in the survival, but with the rate of technology expanding and challenging at very boundaries there are not many days left when we find solutions to these aspects but this idea of colonizing has more to do with monetary terms it has been projected that building a colony at space will cost at about $10 Trillian which is more than many countries GDP. Placing that much of an amount and getting funding for such highly anticipated projects is tough. Elon to have addressed with these questions with an open Door he believes that this cost is nothing when we find a route to colonize space and these costs will be justifiable when space exploration will reach new heights.Also, our world is around water and the percentage of land comparison to water is too less. Whereas the population is increasing with the speed and the level of excitement in order to search for new things and the obsession with the new and innovative things never going to finish. Because in the end, we do not satisfy what we have achieved, we are only looking for other things and crave to achieve that.In order to achieve that planning is most crucial stage. As of now we have searched 9 planets but still didn\\u2019t shortlisted the outcomes. But according to the 3-decade theory of ELON MUSK, it seems to be possible.As the most important thing to survive is the atmospheric environment, whether is this suitable or not, and in order to make it suitable what steps had to take and maintain the suitable level of oxygen.\\u00a0 The missions are now what everyone is focusing about. Finding the source of water, because its 2nd crucial thing which is needed to survive.Apart from the excitement and the things, the threats or the uncertainties are bound to happen like any kind of mammal which could occur during construction or after that. So the security for that or any protection so that uncertainties could be replicated.After the basic things, other factors like what are the natural habitats available there, whether the plants could be grown over there or not. If yes, then what types of plants could survive there.The environment for the animals is safe or not. Because to balance the nature we need all types of animals, natural habitat, even insects and other small things which seems to be ignorable but plays an important role in maintaining the environmental balance. For e.g.\\u00a0 \\u2013 Ants are among the leading predators of other insects, helping to keep pest populations low.\\u00a0 Ants move approximately the same amount of soil as earthworms, loosening the soil in the process and increasing air and water movement into the ground.\\u00a0 They keep the ecosystem clean of dead insect carcasses and aid in the destruction and decomposition of plant and animal matter.\\u00a0So, every small thing contributes in its own way.Another matter of concern is the level of artificial intelligence and machine learning required to maintain that kind of requirement. Because as the current scenario, we need energy to run any vehicle or even for the robotics. So, the availability of the energy and the source of energy is needed.And apart from this, the heat of sun is equally important in order to maintain the level. Because with artificial air we can survive but not for so long. So, in order to remain healthy as well the calculation has to be done. When thinking about disease, you may have heard in the news about the concern that antibiotics (such as penicillin) \\u2013 which help fight infections \\u2013 may eventually stop working. Global health organisations are trying to reduce the use of antibiotics, especially for conditions that aren\\u2019t serious. This is because their overuse in recent years means that they\\u2019re becoming less effective.But still we can survive without antibiotics. Because there are ways\\u00a0of dealing with diseases caused by bacteria such as isolation which is how they were treated before penicillin.It might sound like something set firmly in the realm of fantasy, but experts in private industry and governments around the world are trying to understand how feasible it would be to establish a lunar base. Some scientists think humans could survive comfortably on the moon. In some ways, the very minimal gravity of the moon might actually be more conducive to life than the microgravity astronauts experience on the International Space Station.Although it hasn\\u2019t been formally tested, some experts hypothesize that the small amount of gravitational force put on an astronaut\\u2019s body when on the moon\\u00a0could help stem some of the adverse effects like bone-density and muscle loss that space flyers experience while living in microgravity on the International Space Station.By using the moon\\u2019s indigenous material, space agencies can save money on the cost of flying pricey missions to and from the moon\\u2019s surface.\\u00a0Once on the moon, instead of having to stage costly missions aimed at delivering oxygen and other necessary resources from Earth, experts might be able to actually use the material to manufacture gasses needed to sustain life on the satellite.On earth, we are protected from radioactive solar winds and cosmic rays by our own magnet field known as the magnetosphere. But out in the space, we can\\u2019t rely on this type of protection, and in order to make that protection, it could take a lot but yes with more upgraded technology it could achieve.Although till now the approximate value of the project is $10 trillion. But the aim is to make the fare equivalent to the normal air fare.As once we are comfortable with all the resources, securities for uncertainties, risk analysis, and the probability of survival of the human being and many other factors after consideration, then development won\\u2019t take much time.Because to construct a building it take normally 8-9 months. Which is totally acceptable.But the main concern is the density of the land, i.e. whether the land has the capacity to bear that much weight or not. And the type of land is adaptable for cultivation or nor. Although land can be converted into different types of cultivation but with the help of upgraded technology.In order to transport the equipments on the regular basis, a large amount of fuel Is required, and other factors as well and Built the propellor depo for rocket landing building various infrastructure for the city one by one will create a way forward for idea of Colonizing at outer space.We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com\\u00a9 All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.

With the development of the new machine programs, A.I. is all set to take over the humans in their workplace as no other did. Now we are not only in competition with other beings but with robots too. And robots will overcome us in our fields of work.At present we are being surrounded by A.I. from dusk till dawn, from facial recognition present in our mobile application to dating websites/applications which uses decision making as their algorithms and learn from the past data as well. It is believed that A.I. has grown over 270% over the last years.First, let us know what A.I. is and all the fuss going on about it?A.I. as defined by the internet is simply \\u2018simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions\\u2019. This translates to, it can work as a human being just at fast speed and with 100% accuracy.In my definition I would define A.I. as the god form of human beings.Now the question that arises is, what does A.I. entails for the future?A.I. is fancy enough to continue existing in our minds all the time, but it does come with certain limitations and threats which is a cause for a peaceful sleep for most of the workers. With its introduction to different areas of the workplace, it is clear that half of the human jobs would be taken up by A.I. and then there would arise a need for more jobs for humans in new upcoming AI-based ventures in different industries. Thereby giving us our fair share back to us.In a survey, it was found that some believed that AI will be devastating for humans and while some professionals and tech-savvy people believed that inculcating AI technology into business and our daily lives would be a remarkable step as it will lead to the flourishment of business in the future and give them a competitive edge over their rivals.People believed that when these advanced technologies would come together to work with humans, they will produce a smarter strategic decision with productive collaborative practices. More modern technology prevailing in the organization will lead to stress reduction and produce more satisfying results thereby making the organization more efficient.The Organizations who are in use of the AI technology responds by saying that their managers are more comfortable using A.I. and are accustomed to it and the organizations are now looking forward to having integration of higher-end technology systems, as it is believed that new technology will result in more productivity thereby making more profits in the long run.Many jobs today require AI and humans working in collaboration, which creates a positive signal that in the future to humans would be working closely with the technology. Beyond just training and developing these machines, humans would be working in close vicinity with them and making decisions on how to act on the result that is given by the machine.It can be said that both the AI advanced technology and human can\\u2019t remain in the workforce without each other, as the technology will produce accurate and top-notch results but it requires someone to make delivery.e.g., in a firm, an AI-based system produces results based on historical data but there is a need for someone to analyze and communicate and present this data to the respective stakeholders whether inside or outside of the organization.Various uses of artificial intelligence technology in day-to-day functions in regards to interactions with humans are:Artificial intelligence as we know works on algorithms, neural networks, and deep learning which all are analytical tools that help AI in taking analytical decisions based on the data provided.Whereas, humans on the other hand take higher-level decisions based on \\u2018Intuition\\u2019 sometimes, which refers to the gut feeling that generates in humans concerning any situation or challenge.AI alone can\\u2019t work to handle critical situations on its own as it needs humans for it to reciprocate them and share the information with stakeholders, and humans alone can\\u2019t anticipate much on the accurate and fast-paced analytical solutions to the problems persisting in place of the situation.The strength of humans and AI working in synergy can be surprisingly beneficial and advantageous to organizations.It is believed that machines in the future would be eating up our traditional jobs. But the reality seems to be turning otherwise.The future trend shows that in future the AI-powered technology would take up jobs that were being done by humans but in return would produce more jobs that would require human interference with them. As and when the newer technology is approaching more and more countries are now proceeding towards GIG Economies, and so in the future, we can witness an increase in freelance jobs and the permanent labor market norms could reduce drastically.Some of the jobs today will be replaced by AI which is in the transportation or retail commerce sector that can be 100% automated in the future years. There is an \\u2018Amazon Go\\u2019 store that uses this technology which goes by the name \\u2018Just walk out technology\\u2019 wherein there is no need for any human-induced workforce and all the operations are carried out by AI-powered technologies, which is indeed a breakthrough technology in today\\u2019s world.Rather than eating up our jobs AI in return will be creating more jobs in the future by creating massive innovations thereby fueling up many new industries and thereby giving us our fair share of jobs back.There will be a lot of demand placed on the upcoming young workforce which is also categorized as \\u2018Gen Z\\u2019. They are expected to know more about technology and would be high in demand. \\u00a0These young generations are required to learn new skills which are needed to survive in the dynamic changing environment, and as most of the activities that are carried out by workers will be automated, there will be demand for people working in the back office and maintaining and developing the technology to its best versions.AI powered technology has its limitations which makes it a rigid system to hold on to and also which makes it a costly affair at the initial stage.It was predicted that the cost of electricity to power a supercharged AI model was around $4.6 million. So, this super-powered AI can be purchased only by big fortune firms and thereby creating more value to their net worth.One of the major limitations of AI is that it can contain biased data as the scientists who put in the data can create biasedness and so the resultant output of the same would have a biased report.These machines as do not have neuroscience-based technology in them yet which enables them to carry human emotions to understand complex situations and a creative way out of that, they tend to have a lack of out of box thinking which in the case is rigid in themselves as they are programmed to work on a single task and they cannot perform more than a single task at the same time.It is also believed that there exists no creativity among the computer, no matter it is fast-paced, but they are not intelligent.Businesses and organizations need to understand and anticipate the opportunities that the future holds for them and they need to start training their employees based on today\\u2019s dynamic changing technology. While it\\u2019s still unclear what does the future holds for us, but the anticipation of it could benefit us in several ways.As we are unclear about what the future looks like, we need to think in probable terms how it could turn out to be and then employ specific training programs for the employees of the organization.The training the employees are needed to be done on a continuous and lifetime basis which means that education won\\u2019t be only limited to PG degrees but will be now a lifetime process of learning.As the Covid-19 changed the scenario of the work patterns around the world, we now need to think strategically about the working dynamics of the future and how does it look like compared to the pre-covid and post-covid scenario.Employees will be playing a major role in transforming the organizations and work practices in the upcoming future, so organizations need to select and recruit the best candidates among the pool and then provide them with best practices of the new machines and make proficient in their area of work. Policies need to be developed to hire the best people and then retaining the talent in the organization.There needs to be a continuous scanning of the environment by the organizations to comprehend any new trends and assess them, not all trends will be beneficial for organizations, they must be aware of the prospects and plan for the future systematically and consistently.There lies a possibility in future certain years from now, we could have machines who will have general human intelligence who would be able to answer deep meaningful questions asking \\u2018Why are the curtains blue?\\u2019, would be able to clean cars, play politics and tell jokes to us, and by using deep and machine learning programs their level of intelligence would be beyond mathematical calculations to us. That\\u2019s how good machines will be in the future, but to make ourselves competitive with machines, we would need to train ourselves for the impending ambiguous future ahead of us.Humans and machines need to work in synergy to get beneficial and satisfying results for both parties.Machines are indeed going take away many of our jobs, but let me make you sleep peacefully tonight, the machines aren\\u2019t arriving until we\\u2019re retired.We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com\\u00a9 All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.

With businesses being shut, travel being banned, schools, and colleges being closed, we have observed an impeccable amount of sorrow and despise along with a great amount of mental torture and destruction. Though situations are improving now, and the lockdowns are being lifted, it is a fact that it cannot be shunned that this virus will have a long term impact on people, and the effects will not only be felt economically and physically but also mentally.We\\u2019ve been reading articles regarding the impact of COVID 19 on the economy, education, mental health, and every other possible aspect. But one topic which has not been talked about much is the impact of COVID 19 on office space and co-working industries. Well, it is quite obvious that offices will start functioning now, but, the COVID period hasn\\u2019t ended. This means that social distancing will also have to be followed in offices; where it will be a problem to do so because of the lack of adequate infrastructure and space. The same will be the condition in co-working industries, wherein employees of different companies come and work together under the same roof.However, these problems are quite obvious (though people haven\\u2019t thought about them much), but the fact which people fail to notice and understand is that the meaning of space is not only limited to infrastructural space which is measured in square foot or square meters; but it also extends to metal space, or for that fact, space in the minds of people for others and their thoughts as well as opinions.Coronavirus has left a big scratch in our country; just the way a car needs repair after an accident, our country will also need repair after the control of this virus. But, unlike a car, our country will require a large amount of time to get restored and to stand straight without any support.Needless to say, the economic stability of our country will definitely be hit because of this reason. But the problem is since the earnings of the employers will reduce, it will subsequently lead to a drop in the salary of the employees. While some employees might be preferred by their bosses and may receive a raise regularly, others might be subjected to unfair treatment and made to do the same amount of work for a lower salary.People tend to overlook the thin line which exists between cooperation and competition. The problem doesn\\u2019t arise when such a situation happens wherein an employee is getting paid more than the other, but instead, it arises when people start to compare their earnings as well as benefits to that of others. And in today\\u2019s world, where people keep money at the top of their priority list, comparisons will play a very important role in the performance of employees and their company.Since there will exist inequalities and partialities in companies, there will also exist a sense of hatred and competition among the employees of the same company; who will compete to get a better position or a raise in their salary. This may seem beneficial to some as it might compel the employees to work harder and better, but however, will bring huge losses in the long run. The fact is; employees might end up doing unethical acts which will help them to make a better impression in their boss\\u2019s eyes.Moreover, since there will be comparisons among the employees, it might happen that the \\u2018Employee of the Month\\u2019 ends up being hated by all other employees in the company. Another situation that might arise is that of bluffing and pretending; wherein employees tend to show that they work very hard but they don\\u2019t. This might be practiced by showing the boss that they are working when he is on around, and then chilling the rest of the time when the boss goes home or sits in his office. In fact, employees might also lose interest in working if they sense repeated partialities and inequalities; which they might show by quitting the jobs or not performing to their best.Such situations will definitely arise in companies and offices; wherein employees will compete for attention and resources; which will have a great impact on the company and its functioning. And all this will happen because of only one thing; lack of office mental space i.e. space in the minds of people working together in a particular office for cooperation and teamwork, along with ignorance of the fact that things will get better and eventually the same after some time.Another kind of industry and companies that will be affected due to the long-lasting impact of COVID 19 is the co-working industry and offices. This is because, there will be a shortage of resources and the income of people, but the maintenance cost to be born for the infrastructure, as well the rent will remain the same. Because of this, employees will be told by the company owners to exploit the resources present in the offices and use them to the fullest; to compensate for the losses being born and to make better use of the money being used. However, the number of resources will be the same, and so, there will be a case of competition between employees of different companies to use resources and take benefits of the same.If the above two situations happen to occur at the same time (which they most likely will), we will observe a scene of intra-company as well as inter-company competition. Also, our personal relations with other employees in the company might also be affected due to this comparison and competition; which itself will be a result of limited mental space.COVID 19 will have severe impacts on the office (mental) space of companies and people.\\u00a0 People\\u2019s thoughts, how they treat others, along with accepting defeat and rejection will be an important aspect of everyone\\u2019s lives. Moreover, we might also observe a shoot in the intensity and frequency of office people going to psychologists; because of repeated rejection and unfair treatment. However, we need to cope with this thing and realize that it is indeed very important for us to start preparing to expand our mental space and that this competition and comparison will not stay for long and should not affect our personal relations and life at any cost.We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com\\u00a9 All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.

Though in this 21st-century building Space shuttle and exploring space has become an obvious activity among the human raise, now with the inclusion of Start-ups like Space X once dreamed for reaching out at space now is coming true. We all have to agree upon a fact that in the Growth of industrialization we have generated a humungous carbon footprint and colonize at outer space will create a much-needed area for our survival.With time the human race has visualized and has undergone many transformations, and these transformations may for starters were not that effective but were a major role at existence to this age. Be it a natural transformation like shifting of tectonic plates or manmade like Dumping water and damaging water bodies, somehow have affected usual life of humans so creating space of humans is what next humans are eyeing for.All this idea for Colonizing in outer space emerged when NASA was able to launch a space shuttle with a heavy payload in the late 1990s this idea didn\\u2019t stir brain at that time but later was like apple eyes when various articles from astronauts and their writeup came into limelight and this idea saw its progression, space exploration was not a new normal, companies were petrified by the number of investments that these kinds of projects ask for. But things change with the entry of PayPal\\u2019s owner Elon Musk, in 2002 where he laid stones of Space X, with NASA providing the launchpad for their exploration.Being space travel legitimate there where many bottlenecks knowing the nature of outer space will boost the idea of colonizing, here one has to realize the optimum. But the main target that these company put forward with themself was to not just get into other planet but to get back at earth safely, earlier these projects due to high fund was always subdued and priority was given to the rocket technology. Thus, this unimaginable quest for the search of space was far-fetched though.Now being in 2020 we do not find it out of a place of colonizing outside of space, the kind of emergence of technologies has led to the escalation of spreading the roots of human existence, the plan for reaching out to outer space too plays a key role for this idea too. Proper Planning, Analysing, Organising, and Executing were required for these projects to be successful for deeper know how I would like to mention here an example of Space X, According to them they wud be successful for sending Rockets by 2022 and would able to colonize by 2050, For achieving these vision they have planned a total of 36 times pre-launch of the same rocket which they will be launching by 2020. Not only that they have already placed their star link satellites which will provide the basic network connectivity for their colonized world, they have planned this to that extent that they have targeted a profit of $ 22 billion yearly by 2025. Already they have sent the first manned rocket successfully what Elon musk plan is to create that infrastructure by which going to Mars with cost as a regular air flight ticket all this will lead to better chances for colonizing at another planet. With setting up their commercial flight once started to the red planet it wud just be a stepping stone for the colonizing at the outer space.But the fundamental change that people have to undergo while living on another planet will be a change in gravity and being able to be near to live support if any technical issues arise to their suit until unless we find a similar place like the earth that is the change which humans have to adjust. Aspects like Ultraviolet rays too will play an immense role in the survival, but with the rate of technology expanding and challenging at very boundaries there are not many days left when we find solutions to these aspects but this idea of colonizing has more to do with monetary terms it has been projected that building a colony at space will cost at about $10 Trillian which is more than many countries GDP. Placing that much of an amount and getting funding for such highly anticipated projects is tough. Elon to have addressed with these questions with an open Door he believes that this cost is nothing when we find a route to colonize space and these costs will be justifiable when space exploration will reach new heights.Also, our world is around water and the percentage of land comparison to water is too less. Whereas the population is increasing with the speed and the level of excitement in order to search for new things and the obsession with the new and innovative things never going to finish. Because in the end, we do not satisfy what we have achieved, we are only looking for other things and crave to achieve that.In order to achieve that planning is most crucial stage. As of now we have searched 9 planets but still didn\\u2019t shortlisted the outcomes. But according to the 3-decade theory of ELON MUSK, it seems to be possible.As the most important thing to survive is the atmospheric environment, whether is this suitable or not, and in order to make it suitable what steps had to take and maintain the suitable level of oxygen.\\u00a0 The missions are now what everyone is focusing about. Finding the source of water, because its 2nd crucial thing which is needed to survive.Apart from the excitement and the things, the threats or the uncertainties are bound to happen like any kind of mammal which could occur during construction or after that. So the security for that or any protection so that uncertainties could be replicated.After the basic things, other factors like what are the natural habitats available there, whether the plants could be grown over there or not. If yes, then what types of plants could survive there.The environment for the animals is safe or not. Because to balance the nature we need all types of animals, natural habitat, even insects and other small things which seems to be ignorable but plays an important role in maintaining the environmental balance. For e.g.\\u00a0 \\u2013 Ants are among the leading predators of other insects, helping to keep pest populations low.\\u00a0 Ants move approximately the same amount of soil as earthworms, loosening the soil in the process and increasing air and water movement into the ground.\\u00a0 They keep the ecosystem clean of dead insect carcasses and aid in the destruction and decomposition of plant and animal matter.\\u00a0So, every small thing contributes in its own way.Another matter of concern is the level of artificial intelligence and machine learning required to maintain that kind of requirement. Because as the current scenario, we need energy to run any vehicle or even for the robotics. So, the availability of the energy and the source of energy is needed.And apart from this, the heat of sun is equally important in order to maintain the level. Because with artificial air we can survive but not for so long. So, in order to remain healthy as well the calculation has to be done. When thinking about disease, you may have heard in the news about the concern that antibiotics (such as penicillin) \\u2013 which help fight infections \\u2013 may eventually stop working. Global health organisations are trying to reduce the use of antibiotics, especially for conditions that aren\\u2019t serious. This is because their overuse in recent years means that they\\u2019re becoming less effective.But still we can survive without antibiotics. Because there are ways\\u00a0of dealing with diseases caused by bacteria such as isolation which is how they were treated before penicillin.It might sound like something set firmly in the realm of fantasy, but experts in private industry and governments around the world are trying to understand how feasible it would be to establish a lunar base. Some scientists think humans could survive comfortably on the moon. In some ways, the very minimal gravity of the moon might actually be more conducive to life than the microgravity astronauts experience on the International Space Station.Although it hasn\\u2019t been formally tested, some experts hypothesize that the small amount of gravitational force put on an astronaut\\u2019s body when on the moon\\u00a0could help stem some of the adverse effects like bone-density and muscle loss that space flyers experience while living in microgravity on the International Space Station.By using the moon\\u2019s indigenous material, space agencies can save money on the cost of flying pricey missions to and from the moon\\u2019s surface.\\u00a0Once on the moon, instead of having to stage costly missions aimed at delivering oxygen and other necessary resources from Earth, experts might be able to actually use the material to manufacture gasses needed to sustain life on the satellite.On earth, we are protected from radioactive solar winds and cosmic rays by our own magnet field known as the magnetosphere. But out in the space, we can\\u2019t rely on this type of protection, and in order to make that protection, it could take a lot but yes with more upgraded technology it could achieve.Although till now the approximate value of the project is $10 trillion. But the aim is to make the fare equivalent to the normal air fare.As once we are comfortable with all the resources, securities for uncertainties, risk analysis, and the probability of survival of the human being and many other factors after consideration, then development won\\u2019t take much time.Because to construct a building it take normally 8-9 months. Which is totally acceptable.But the main concern is the density of the land, i.e. whether the land has the capacity to bear that much weight or not.

With the development of the new machine programs, A.I. is all set to take over the humans in their workplace as no other did. Now we are not only in competition with other beings but with robots too. And robots will overcome us in our fields of work.At present we are being surrounded by A.I. from dusk till dawn, from facial recognition present in our mobile application to dating websites/applications which uses decision making as their algorithms and learn from the past data as well. It is believed that A.I. has grown over 270% over the last years.First, let us know what A.I. is and all the fuss going on about it?A.I. as defined by the internet is simply \\u2018simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions\\u2019. This translates to, it can work as a human being just at fast speed and with 100% accuracy.In my definition I would define A.I. as the god form of human beings.Now the question that arises is, what does A.I. entails for the future?A.I. is fancy enough to continue existing in our minds all the time, but it does come with certain limitations and threats which is a cause for a peaceful sleep for most of the workers. With its introduction to different areas of the workplace, it is clear that half of the human jobs would be taken up by A.I. and then there would arise a need for more jobs for humans in new upcoming AI-based ventures in different industries. Thereby giving us our fair share back to us.In a survey, it was found that some believed that AI will be devastating for humans and while some professionals and tech-savvy people believed that inculcating AI technology into business and our daily lives would be a remarkable step as it will lead to the flourishment of business in the future and give them a competitive edge over their rivals.People believed that when these advanced technologies would come together to work with humans, they will produce a smarter strategic decision with productive collaborative practices. More modern technology prevailing in the organization will lead to stress reduction and produce more satisfying results thereby making the organization more efficient.The Organizations who are in use of the AI technology responds by saying that their managers are more comfortable using A.I. and are accustomed to it and the organizations are now looking forward to having integration of higher-end technology systems, as it is believed that new technology will result in more productivity thereby making more profits in the long run.Many jobs today require AI and humans working in collaboration, which creates a positive signal that in the future to humans would be working closely with the technology. Beyond just training and developing these machines, humans would be working in close vicinity with them and making decisions on how to act on the result that is given by the machine.It can be said that both the AI advanced technology and human can\\u2019t remain in the workforce without each other, as the technology will produce accurate and top-notch results but it requires someone to make delivery.e.g., in a firm, an AI-based system produces results based on historical data but there is a need for someone to analyze and communicate and present this data to the respective stakeholders whether inside or outside of the organization.Various uses of artificial intelligence technology in day-to-day functions in regards to interactions with humans are:Artificial intelligence as we know works on algorithms, neural networks, and deep learning which all are analytical tools that help AI in taking analytical decisions based on the data provided.Whereas, humans on the other hand take higher-level decisions based on \\u2018Intuition\\u2019 sometimes, which refers to the gut feeling that generates in humans concerning any situation or challenge.AI alone can\\u2019t work to handle critical situations on its own as it needs humans for it to reciprocate them and share the information with stakeholders, and humans alone can\\u2019t anticipate much on the accurate and fast-paced analytical solutions to the problems persisting in place of the situation.The strength of humans and AI working in synergy can be surprisingly beneficial and advantageous to organizations.It is believed that machines in the future would be eating up our traditional jobs. But the reality seems to be turning otherwise.The future trend shows that in future the AI-powered technology would take up jobs that were being done by humans but in return would produce more jobs that would require human interference with them. As and when the newer technology is approaching more and more countries are now proceeding towards GIG Economies, and so in the future, we can witness an increase in freelance jobs and the permanent labor market norms could reduce drastically.Some of the jobs today will be replaced by AI which is in the transportation or retail commerce sector that can be 100% automated in the future years. There is an \\u2018Amazon Go\\u2019 store that uses this technology which goes by the name \\u2018Just walk out technology\\u2019 wherein there is no need for any human-induced workforce and all the operations are carried out by AI-powered technologies, which is indeed a breakthrough technology in today\\u2019s world.Rather than eating up our jobs AI in return will be creating more jobs in the future by creating massive innovations thereby fueling up many new industries and thereby giving us our fair share of jobs back.There will be a lot of demand placed on the upcoming young workforce which is also categorized as \\u2018Gen Z\\u2019. They are expected to know more about technology and would be high in demand. \\u00a0These young generations are required to learn new skills which are needed to survive in the dynamic changing environment, and as most of the activities that are carried out by workers will be automated, there will be demand for people working in the back office and maintaining and developing the technology to its best versions.AI powered technology has its limitations which makes it a rigid system to hold on to and also which makes it a costly affair at the initial stage.It was predicted that the cost of electricity to power a supercharged AI model was around $4.6 million. So, this super-powered AI can be purchased only by big fortune firms and thereby creating more value to their net worth.One of the major limitations of AI is that it can contain biased data as the scientists who put in the data can create biasedness and so the resultant output of the same would have a biased report.These machines as do not have neuroscience-based technology in them yet which enables them to carry human emotions to understand complex situations and a creative way out of that, they tend to have a lack of out of box thinking which in the case is rigid in themselves as they are programmed to work on a single task and they cannot perform more than a single task at the same time.It is also believed that there exists no creativity among the computer, no matter it is fast-paced, but they are not intelligent.Businesses and organizations need to understand and anticipate the opportunities that the future holds for them and they need to start training their employees based on today\\u2019s dynamic changing technology. While it\\u2019s still unclear what does the future holds for us, but the anticipation of it could benefit us in several ways.As we are unclear about what the future looks like, we need to think in probable terms how it could turn out to be and then employ specific training programs for the employees of the organization.The training the employees are needed to be done on a continuous and lifetime basis which means that education won\\u2019t be only limited to PG degrees but will be now a lifetime process of learning.As the Covid-19 changed the scenario of the work patterns around the world, we now need to think strategically about the working dynamics of the future and how does it look like compared to the pre-covid and post-covid scenario.Employees will be playing a major role in transforming the organizations and work practices in the upcoming future, so organizations need to select and recruit the best candidates among the pool and then provide them with best practices of the new machines and make proficient in their area of work. Policies need to be developed to hire the best people and then retaining the talent in the organization.There needs to be a continuous scanning of the environment by the organizations to comprehend any new trends and assess them, not all trends will be beneficial for organizations, they must be aware of the prospects and plan for the future systematically and consistently.There lies a possibility in future certain years from now, we could have machines who will have general human intelligence who would be able to answer deep meaningful questions asking \\u2018Why are the curtains blue?\\u2019, would be able to clean cars, play politics and tell jokes to us, and by using deep and machine learning programs their level of intelligence would be beyond mathematical calculations to us. That\\u2019s how good machines will be in the future, but to make ourselves competitive with machines, we would need to train ourselves for the impending ambiguous future ahead of us.Humans and machines need to work in synergy to get beneficial and satisfying results for both parties.Machines are indeed going take away many of our jobs, but let me make you sleep peacefully tonight, the machines aren\\u2019t arriving until we\\u2019re retired.We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com\\u00a9 All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.

With businesses being shut, travel being banned, schools, and colleges being closed, we have observed an impeccable amount of sorrow and despise along with a great amount of mental torture and destruction. Though situations are improving now, and the lockdowns are being lifted, it is a fact that it cannot be shunned that this virus will have a long term impact on people, and the effects will not only be felt economically and physically but also mentally.We\\u2019ve been reading articles regarding the impact of COVID 19 on the economy, education, mental health, and every other possible aspect. But one topic which has not been talked about much is the impact of COVID 19 on office space and co-working industries. Well, it is quite obvious that offices will start functioning now, but, the COVID period hasn\\u2019t ended. This means that social distancing will also have to be followed in offices; where it will be a problem to do so because of the lack of adequate infrastructure and space. The same will be the condition in co-working industries, wherein employees of different companies come and work together under the same roof.However, these problems are quite obvious (though people haven\\u2019t thought about them much), but the fact which people fail to notice and understand is that the meaning of space is not only limited to infrastructural space which is measured in square foot or square meters; but it also extends to metal space, or for that fact, space in the minds of people for others and their thoughts as well as opinions.Coronavirus has left a big scratch in our country; just the way a car needs repair after an accident, our country will also need repair after the control of this virus. But, unlike a car, our country will require a large amount of time to get restored and to stand straight without any support.Needless to say, the economic stability of our country will definitely be hit because of this reason. But the problem is since the earnings of the employers will reduce, it will subsequently lead to a drop in the salary of the employees. While some employees might be preferred by their bosses and may receive a raise regularly, others might be subjected to unfair treatment and made to do the same amount of work for a lower salary.People tend to overlook the thin line which exists between cooperation and competition. The problem doesn\\u2019t arise when such a situation happens wherein an employee is getting paid more than the other, but instead, it arises when people start to compare their earnings as well as benefits to that of others. And in today\\u2019s world, where people keep money at the top of their priority list, comparisons will play a very important role in the performance of employees and their company.Since there will exist inequalities and partialities in companies, there will also exist a sense of hatred and competition among the employees of the same company; who will compete to get a better position or a raise in their salary. This may seem beneficial to some as it might compel the employees to work harder and better, but however, will bring huge losses in the long run. The fact is; employees might end up doing unethical acts which will help them to make a better impression in their boss\\u2019s eyes.Moreover, since there will be comparisons among the employees, it might happen that the \\u2018Employee of the Month\\u2019 ends up being hated by all other employees in the company. Another situation that might arise is that of bluffing and pretending; wherein employees tend to show that they work very hard but they don\\u2019t. This might be practiced by showing the boss that they are working when he is on around, and then chilling the rest of the time when the boss goes home or sits in his office. In fact, employees might also lose interest in working if they sense repeated partialities and inequalities; which they might show by quitting the jobs or not performing to their best.Such situations will definitely arise in companies and offices; wherein employees will compete for attention and resources; which will have a great impact on the company and its functioning. And all this will happen because of only one thing; lack of office mental space i.e. space in the minds of people working together in a particular office for cooperation and teamwork, along with ignorance of the fact that things will get better and eventually the same after some time.Another kind of industry and companies that will be affected due to the long-lasting impact of COVID 19 is the co-working industry and offices. This is because, there will be a shortage of resources and the income of people, but the maintenance cost to be born for the infrastructure, as well the rent will remain the same. Because of this, employees will be told by the company owners to exploit the resources present in the offices and use them to the fullest; to compensate for the losses being born and to make better use of the money being used. However, the number of resources will be the same, and so, there will be a case of competition between employees of different companies to use resources and take benefits of the same.If the above two situations happen to occur at the same time (which they most likely will), we will observe a scene of intra-company as well as inter-company competition. Also, our personal relations with other employees in the company might also be affected due to this comparison and competition; which itself will be a result of limited mental space.COVID 19 will have severe impacts on the office (mental) space of companies and people.\\u00a0 People\\u2019s thoughts, how they treat others, along with accepting defeat and rejection will be an important aspect of everyone\\u2019s lives. Moreover, we might also observe a shoot in the intensity and frequency of office people going to psychologists; because of repeated rejection and unfair treatment. However, we need to cope with this thing and realize that it is indeed very important for us to start preparing to expand our mental space and that this competition and comparison will not stay for long and should not affect our personal relations and life at any cost.We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com\\u00a9 All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.

Though in this 21st-century building Space shuttle and exploring space has become an obvious activity among the human raise, now with the inclusion of Start-ups like Space X once dreamed for reaching out at space now is coming true. We all have to agree upon a fact that in the Growth of industrialization we have generated a humungous carbon footprint and colonize at outer space will create a much-needed area for our survival.With time the human race has visualized and has undergone many transformations, and these transformations may for starters were not that effective but were a major role at existence to this age. Be it a natural transformation like shifting of tectonic plates or manmade like Dumping water and damaging water bodies, somehow have affected usual life of humans so creating space of humans is what next humans are eyeing for.All this idea for Colonizing in outer space emerged when NASA was able to launch a space shuttle with a heavy payload in the late 1990s this idea didn\\u2019t stir brain at that time but later was like apple eyes when various articles from astronauts and their writeup came into limelight and this idea saw its progression, space exploration was not a new normal, companies were petrified by the number of investments that these kinds of projects ask for. But things change with the entry of PayPal\\u2019s owner Elon Musk, in 2002 where he laid stones of Space X, with NASA providing the launchpad for their exploration.Being space travel legitimate there where many bottlenecks knowing the nature of outer space will boost the idea of colonizing, here one has to realize the optimum. But the main target that these company put forward with themself was to not just get into other planet but to get back at earth safely, earlier these projects due to high fund was always subdued and priority was given to the rocket technology. Thus, this unimaginable quest for the search of space was far-fetched though.Now being in 2020 we do not find it out of a place of colonizing outside of space, the kind of emergence of technologies has led to the escalation of spreading the roots of human existence, the plan for reaching out to outer space too plays a key role for this idea too. Proper Planning, Analysing, Organising, and Executing were required for these projects to be successful for deeper know how I would like to mention here an example of Space X, According to them they wud be successful for sending Rockets by 2022 and would able to colonize by 2050, For achieving these vision they have planned a total of 36 times pre-launch of the same rocket which they will be launching by 2020. Not only that they have already placed their star link satellites which will provide the basic network connectivity for their colonized world, they have planned this to that extent that they have targeted a profit of $ 22 billion yearly by 2025. Already they have sent the first manned rocket successfully what Elon musk plan is to create that infrastructure by which going to Mars with cost as a regular air flight ticket all this will lead to better chances for colonizing at another planet. With setting up their commercial flight once started to the red planet it wud just be a stepping stone for the colonizing at the outer space.But the fundamental change that people have to undergo while living on another planet will be a change in gravity and being able to be near to live support if any technical issues arise to their suit until unless we find a similar place like the earth that is the change which humans have to adjust. Aspects like Ultraviolet rays too will play an immense role in the survival, but with the rate of technology expanding and challenging at very boundaries there are not many days left when we find solutions to these aspects but this idea of colonizing has more to do with monetary terms it has been projected that building a colony at space will cost at about $10 Trillian which is more than many countries GDP. Placing that much of an amount and getting funding for such highly anticipated projects is tough. Elon to have addressed with these questions with an open Door he believes that this cost is nothing when we find a route to colonize space and these costs will be justifiable when space exploration will reach new heights.Also, our world is around water and the percentage of land comparison to water is too less. Whereas the population is increasing with the speed and the level of excitement in order to search for new things and the obsession with the new and innovative things never going to finish. Because in the end, we do not satisfy what we have achieved, we are only looking for other things and crave to achieve that.In order to achieve that planning is most crucial stage. As of now we have searched 9 planets but still didn\\u2019t shortlisted the outcomes. But according to the 3-decade theory of ELON MUSK, it seems to be possible.As the most important thing to survive is the atmospheric environment, whether is this suitable or not, and in order to make it suitable what steps had to take and maintain the suitable level of oxygen.\\u00a0 The missions are now what everyone is focusing about. Finding the source of water, because its 2nd crucial thing which is needed to survive.Apart from the excitement and the things, the threats or the uncertainties are bound to happen like any kind of mammal which could occur during construction or after that. So the security for that or any protection so that uncertainties could be replicated.After the basic things, other factors like what are the natural habitats available there, whether the plants could be grown over there or not. If yes, then what types of plants could survive there.The environment for the animals is safe or not. Because to balance the nature we need all types of animals, natural habitat, even insects and other small things which seems to be ignorable but plays an important role in maintaining the environmental balance. For e.g.\\u00a0 \\u2013 Ants are among the leading predators of other insects, helping to keep pest populations low.\\u00a0 Ants move approximately the same amount of soil as earthworms, loosening the soil in the process and increasing air and water movement into the ground.\\u00a0 They keep the ecosystem clean of dead insect carcasses and aid in the destruction and decomposition of plant and animal matter.\\u00a0So, every small thing contributes in its own way.Another matter of concern is the level of artificial intelligence and machine learning required to maintain that kind of requirement. Because as the current scenario, we need energy to run any vehicle or even for the robotics. So, the availability of the energy and the source of energy is needed.And apart from this, the heat of sun is equally important in order to maintain the level. Because with artificial air we can survive but not for so long. So, in order to remain healthy as well the calculation has to be done. When thinking about disease, you may have heard in the news about the concern that antibiotics (such as penicillin) \\u2013 which help fight infections \\u2013 may eventually stop working. Global health organisations are trying to reduce the use of antibiotics, especially for conditions that aren\\u2019t serious. This is because their overuse in recent years means that they\\u2019re becoming less effective.But still we can survive without antibiotics. Because there are ways\\u00a0of dealing with diseases caused by bacteria such as isolation which is how they were treated before penicillin.It might sound like something set firmly in the realm of fantasy, but experts in private industry and governments around the world are trying to understand how feasible it would be to establish a lunar base. Some scientists think humans could survive comfortably on the moon. In some ways, the very minimal gravity of the moon might actually be more conducive to life than the microgravity astronauts experience on the International Space Station.Although it hasn\\u2019t been formally tested, some experts hypothesize that the small amount of gravitational force put on an astronaut\\u2019s body when on the moon\\u00a0could help stem some of the adverse effects like bone-density and muscle loss that space flyers experience while living in microgravity on the International Space Station.By using the moon\\u2019s indigenous material, space agencies can save money on the cost of flying pricey missions to and from the moon\\u2019s surface.\\u00a0Once on the moon, instead of having to stage costly missions aimed at delivering oxygen and other necessary resources from Earth, experts might be able to actually use the material to manufacture gasses needed to sustain life on the satellite.On earth, we are protected from radioactive solar winds and cosmic rays by our own magnet field known as the magnetosphere. But out in the space, we can\\u2019t rely on this type of protection, and in order to make that protection, it could take a lot but yes with more upgraded technology it could achieve.Although till now the approximate value of the project is $10 trillion. But the aim is to make the fare equivalent to the normal air fare.As once we are comfortable with all the resources, securities for uncertainties, risk analysis, and the probability of survival of the human being and many other factors after consideration, then development won\\u2019t take much time.Because to construct a building it take normally 8-9 months. Which is totally acceptable.But the main concern is the density of the land, i.e. whether the land has the capacity to bear that much weight or not. And the type of land is adaptable for cultivation or nor. Although land can be converted into different types of cultivation but with the help of upgraded technology.In order to transport the equipments on the regular basis, a large amount of fuel Is required, and other factors as well and Built the propellor depo for rocket landing building various infrastructure for the city one by one will create a way forward for idea of Colonizing at outer space.We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com\\u00a9 All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.

With the development of the new machine programs, A.I. is all set to take over the humans in their workplace as no other did. Now we are not only in competition with other beings but with robots too. And robots will overcome us in our fields of work.At present we are being surrounded by A.I. from dusk till dawn, from facial recognition present in our mobile application to dating websites/applications which uses decision making as their algorithms and learn from the past data as well. It is believed that A.I. has grown over 270% over the last years.First, let us know what A.I. is and all the fuss going on about it?A.I. as defined by the internet is simply \\u2018simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions\\u2019. This translates to, it can work as a human being just at fast speed and with 100% accuracy.In my definition I would define A.I. as the god form of human beings.Now the question that arises is, what does A.I. entails for the future?A.I. is fancy enough to continue existing in our minds all the time, but it does come with certain limitations and threats which is a cause for a peaceful sleep for most of the workers. With its introduction to different areas of the workplace, it is clear that half of the human jobs would be taken up by A.I. and then there would arise a need for more jobs for humans in new upcoming AI-based ventures in different industries. Thereby giving us our fair share back to us.In a survey, it was found that some believed that AI will be devastating for humans and while some professionals and tech-savvy people believed that inculcating AI technology into business and our daily lives would be a remarkable step as it will lead to the flourishment of business in the future and give them a competitive edge over their rivals.People believed that when these advanced technologies would come together to work with humans, they will produce a smarter strategic decision with productive collaborative practices. More modern technology prevailing in the organization will lead to stress reduction and produce more satisfying results thereby making the organization more efficient.The Organizations who are in use of the AI technology responds by saying that their managers are more comfortable using A.I. and are accustomed to it and the organizations are now looking forward to having integration of higher-end technology systems, as it is believed that new technology will result in more productivity thereby making more profits in the long run.Many jobs today require AI and humans working in collaboration, which creates a positive signal that in the future to humans would be working closely with the technology. Beyond just training and developing these machines, humans would be working in close vicinity with them and making decisions on how to act on the result that is given by the machine.It can be said that both the AI advanced technology and human can\\u2019t remain in the workforce without each other, as the technology will produce accurate and top-notch results but it requires someone to make delivery.e.g., in a firm, an AI-based system produces results based on historical data but there is a need for someone to analyze and communicate and present this data to the respective stakeholders whether inside or outside of the organization.Various uses of artificial intelligence technology in day-to-day functions in regards to interactions with humans are:Artificial intelligence as we know works on algorithms, neural networks, and deep learning which all are analytical tools that help AI in taking analytical decisions based on the data provided.Whereas, humans on the other hand take higher-level decisions based on \\u2018Intuition\\u2019 sometimes, which refers to the gut feeling that generates in humans concerning any situation or challenge.AI alone can\\u2019t work to handle critical situations on its own as it needs humans for it to reciprocate them and share the information with stakeholders, and humans alone can\\u2019t anticipate much on the accurate and fast-paced analytical solutions to the problems persisting in place of the situation.The strength of humans and AI working in synergy can be surprisingly beneficial and advantageous to organizations.It is believed that machines in the future would be eating up our traditional jobs. But the reality seems to be turning otherwise.The future trend shows that in future the AI-powered technology would take up jobs that were being done by humans but in return would produce more jobs that would require human interference with them. As and when the newer technology is approaching more and more countries are now proceeding towards GIG Economies, and so in the future, we can witness an increase in freelance jobs and the permanent labor market norms could reduce drastically.Some of the jobs today will be replaced by AI which is in the transportation or retail commerce sector that can be 100% automated in the future years. There is an \\u2018Amazon Go\\u2019 store that uses this technology which goes by the name \\u2018Just walk out technology\\u2019 wherein there is no need for any human-induced workforce and all the operations are carried out by AI-powered technologies, which is indeed a breakthrough technology in today\\u2019s world.Rather than eating up our jobs AI in return will be creating more jobs in the future by creating massive innovations thereby fueling up many new industries and thereby giving us our fair share of jobs back.There will be a lot of demand placed on the upcoming young workforce which is also categorized as \\u2018Gen Z\\u2019. They are expected to know more about technology and would be high in demand. \\u00a0These young generations are required to learn new skills which are needed to survive in the dynamic changing environment, and as most of the activities that are carried out by workers will be automated, there will be demand for people working in the back office and maintaining and developing the technology to its best versions.AI powered technology has its limitations which makes it a rigid system to hold on to and also which makes it a costly affair at the initial stage.It was predicted that the cost of electricity to power a supercharged AI model was around $4.6 million. So, this super-powered AI can be purchased only by big fortune firms and thereby creating more value to their net worth.One of the major limitations of AI is that it can contain biased data as the scientists who put in the data can create biasedness and so the resultant output of the same would have a biased report.These machines as do not have neuroscience-based technology in them yet which enables them to carry human emotions to understand complex situations and a creative way out of that, they tend to have a lack of out of box thinking which in the case is rigid in themselves as they are programmed to work on a single task and they cannot perform more than a single task at the same time.It is also believed that there exists no creativity among the computer, no matter it is fast-paced, but they are not intelligent.Businesses and organizations need to understand and anticipate the opportunities that the future holds for them and they need to start training their employees based on today\\u2019s dynamic changing technology. While it\\u2019s still unclear what does the future holds for us, but the anticipation of it could benefit us in several ways.As we are unclear about what the future looks like, we need to think in probable terms how it could turn out to be and then employ specific training programs for the employees of the organization.The training the employees are needed to be done on a continuous and lifetime basis which means that education won\\u2019t be only limited to PG degrees but will be now a lifetime process of learning.As the Covid-19 changed the scenario of the work patterns around the world, we now need to think strategically about the working dynamics of the future and how does it look like compared to the pre-covid and post-covid scenario.Employees will be playing a major role in transforming the organizations and work practices in the upcoming future, so organizations need to select and recruit the best candidates among the pool and then provide them with best practices of the new machines and make proficient in their area of work. Policies need to be developed to hire the best people and then retaining the talent in the organization.There needs to be a continuous scanning of the environment by the organizations to comprehend any new trends and assess them, not all trends will be beneficial for organizations, they must be aware of the prospects and plan for the future systematically and consistently.There lies a possibility in future certain years from now, we could have machines who will have general human intelligence who would be able to answer deep meaningful questions asking \\u2018Why are the curtains blue?\\u2019, would be able to clean cars, play politics and tell jokes to us, and by using deep and machine learning programs their level of intelligence would be beyond mathematical calculations to us. That\\u2019s how good machines will be in the future, but to make ourselves competitive with machines, we would need to train ourselves for the impending ambiguous future ahead of us.Humans and machines need to work in synergy to get beneficial and satisfying results for both parties.Machines are indeed going take away many of our jobs, but let me make you sleep peacefully tonight, the machines aren\\u2019t arriving until we\\u2019re retired.We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com\\u00a9 All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.

With businesses being shut, travel being banned, schools, and colleges being closed, we have observed an impeccable amount of sorrow and despise along with a great amount of mental torture and destruction. Though situations are improving now, and the lockdowns are being lifted, it is a fact that it cannot be shunned that this virus will have a long term impact on people, and the effects will not only be felt economically and physically but also mentally.We\\u2019ve been reading articles regarding the impact of COVID 19 on the economy, education, mental health, and every other possible aspect. But one topic which has not been talked about much is the impact of COVID 19 on office space and co-working industries. Well, it is quite obvious that offices will start functioning now, but, the COVID period hasn\\u2019t ended. This means that social distancing will also have to be followed in offices; where it will be a problem to do so because of the lack of adequate infrastructure and space. The same will be the condition in co-working industries, wherein employees of different companies come and work together under the same roof.However, these problems are quite obvious (though people haven\\u2019t thought about them much), but the fact which people fail to notice and understand is that the meaning of space is not only limited to infrastructural space which is measured in square foot or square meters; but it also extends to metal space, or for that fact, space in the minds of people for others and their thoughts as well as opinions.Coronavirus has left a big scratch in our country; just the way a car needs repair after an accident, our country will also need repair after the control of this virus. But, unlike a car, our country will require a large amount of time to get restored and to stand straight without any support.Needless to say, the economic stability of our country will definitely be hit because of this reason. But the problem is since the earnings of the employers will reduce, it will subsequently lead to a drop in the salary of the employees. While some employees might be preferred by their bosses and may receive a raise regularly, others might be subjected to unfair treatment and made to do the same amount of work for a lower salary.People tend to overlook the thin line which exists between cooperation and competition. The problem doesn\\u2019t arise when such a situation happens wherein an employee is getting paid more than the other, but instead, it arises when people start to compare their earnings as well as benefits to that of others. And in today\\u2019s world, where people keep money at the top of their priority list, comparisons will play a very important role in the performance of employees and their company.Since there will exist inequalities and partialities in companies, there will also exist a sense of hatred and competition among the employees of the same company; who will compete to get a better position or a raise in their salary. This may seem beneficial to some as it might compel the employees to work harder and better, but however, will bring huge losses in the long run. The fact is; employees might end up doing unethical acts which will help them to make a better impression in their boss\\u2019s eyes.Moreover, since there will be comparisons among the employees, it might happen that the \\u2018Employee of the Month\\u2019 ends up being hated by all other employees in the company. Another situation that might arise is that of bluffing and pretending; wherein employees tend to show that they work very hard but they don\\u2019t. This might be practiced by showing the boss that they are working when he is on around, and then chilling the rest of the time when the boss goes home or sits in his office. In fact, employees might also lose interest in working if they sense repeated partialities and inequalities; which they might show by quitting the jobs or not performing to their best.Such situations will definitely arise in companies and offices; wherein employees will compete for attention and resources; which will have a great impact on the company and its functioning. And all this will happen because of only one thing; lack of office mental space i.e. space in the minds of people working together in a particular office for cooperation and teamwork, along with ignorance of the fact that things will get better and eventually the same after some time.Another kind of industry and companies that will be affected due to the long-lasting impact of COVID 19 is the co-working industry and offices. This is because, there will be a shortage of resources and the income of people, but the maintenance cost to be born for the infrastructure, as well the rent will remain the same. Because of this, employees will be told by the company owners to exploit the resources present in the offices and use them to the fullest; to compensate for the losses being born and to make better use of the money being used. However, the number of resources will be the same, and so, there will be a case of competition between employees of different companies to use resources and take benefits of the same.If the above two situations happen to occur at the same time (which they most likely will), we will observe a scene of intra-company as well as inter-company competition. Also, our personal relations with other employees in the company might also be affected due to this comparison and competition; which itself will be a result of limited mental space.COVID 19 will have severe impacts on the office (mental) space of companies and people.\\u00a0 People\\u2019s thoughts, how they treat others, along with accepting defeat and rejection will be an important aspect of everyone\\u2019s lives. Moreover, we might also observe a shoot in the intensity and frequency of office people going to psychologists; because of repeated rejection and unfair treatment. However, we need to cope with this thing and realize that it is indeed very important for us to start preparing to expand our mental space and that this competition and comparison will not stay for long and should not affect our personal relations and life at any cost.We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com\\u00a9 All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.
